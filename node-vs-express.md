# ExpressJS vs NodeJS

## Pros of ExpressJS
- Is easy to use and offers a robust set of features.
- Has powerful routing APIs.
- Has an extendable and customizable architecture.
- Provides various HTTP utility methods and middleware.
- Can be easily integrated with databases like MongoDB, Redis, etc.

## Cons of ExpressJS
- Uses middleware functions extensively which can sometimes lead to a messy codebase.
- Does not have an inbuilt ORM system or any other way to interact with databases.

## Pros of NodeJS
Node.js advantages are numerous and beneficial to all kinds of apps whether you are building a payment system or a video streaming app. Some benefits are identified below.
- Has unmatchable speed due to its non-blocking architecture and event loop feature.
- It is highly scalable despite its single-threadedness.
- It makes debugging easy as it uses Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine to execute code.
- It has a large library of various JavaScript modules that simplifies the development of web applications using NodeJS to a great extent.

## Cons of NodeJS
- Uses asynchronous programming model, which can be confusing for beginner developers. However, once mastered, this model helps to improve app performance and responsiveness.
- Lacks support for some databases, like relational ones. In any case, developers can solve this challenge using frameworks such as Express.js.

## ExpressJS vs Node: Performance Comparison

### ExpressJS
Express is a minimal and flexible NodeJS framework that provides a robust set of features for web applications like routing, sessions, caching, etc. Comparing Node JS vs Node JS Express, the latter manages all the clutter that comes with setting up a server and gives you a simple interface to build your routes and then use them for handling requests made by the users.

### Node.JS
Node.JS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient for the server environment that has to handle multiple concurrent connections with low latency. Using NodeJS will allow you to create such an application because it has high performance and speed.
 
## NodeJS vs ExpressJS: Scalability Comparison

### ExpressJS
Express is primarily a routing and middleware framework that is used to develop web applications, APIs, and mobile applications. Express can be installed as a dependency by using NPM, which makes it easy to use with NodeJS and also extends the base Node capabilities for the development of an application or service. Express vs Node JS when working together are a super combination.

### Node.JS
Node.JS’s asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations allow it to give high throughput and scalability to your application. Node.JS does not create multiple threads for each new connection, but instead manages all connections within that single thread by pushing them into an event loop queue. The thread then handles all those events one by one from the queue.

## NodeJS vs ExpressJS: Testing Comparison

### ExpressJS
Comparing NodeJS vs Express JS, one of the main advantages of using the latter is its ease of testing; it gives you all the tools necessary to easily test your application’s functionality. You can use any testing suite (or framework) like Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, etc. to test the functionality. You can also use Mock objects to simulate external dependencies while testing your code so that you don’t need to spend time writing or maintaining test data or a separate set up just for testing purposes.

### Node.JS
NodeJS makes some big assumptions about how you’ll be structuring your application, meaning you don’t have to worry about setting up a directory structure for your app. This can make writing tests for NodeJS applications much easier, but it also means you could potentially see a lot more issues with how your code is structured if you don’t test it properly.

## When to Choose Node JS?
Because of the difference between Node JS and Express JS, it matters which one you choose for your next project. Node.JS enables you to develop web apps that function on a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones. You can hire remote developers experienced in Node JS and can help you create highly productive and scalable applications. However, you must be able to ask the right Node.js interview questions to uncover their skills.
Node JS development services make it possible for you to reuse the same code for the server as well as the client-side of your app. In addition, the interactive interface of Node JS enables seamless integration with other third-party tools and libraries such as Mongo DB, Angular, React, and so on. If you want a cost-effective development solution, Node JS development is perfect for optimizing expenses due to its open-source nature.

## When to Choose ExpressJS?
ExpressJS is also very minimalist in its approach, allowing you to add specific functionality through middleware. Thus, it is perfect for building an MVP or any lightweight application for an early startup looking to achieve market fit. In addition, one of the main reasons to use ExpressJS is that it’s unopinionated. This means that there is no right or wrong way to do things. You are free to structure your application or website as you like.
This can be both a bad thing and a good thing. The bad thing is that some developers may struggle with structuring their applications because they don’t know where to start. The good thing is that you have complete control over your app and can tailor it exactly how you want it.
