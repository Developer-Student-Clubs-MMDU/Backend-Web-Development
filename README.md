# Backend-Web-Development
Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.
